Getting started
===============

.. note::

   Currently this guide is written assuming you are either developing
   on something like Unix (probably either Linux or macOS). You can use
   software such as `Virtual Box <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ to run
   a 'virtual' Linux machine on another operating system; in this case
   we recommend using the most recent `Ubuntu LTS
   release <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS>`_.

   It should be possible to build and develop Xapian on Windows,
   but we currently don't have any documentation on doing so, or
   any active developers with suitable experience.

Getting the source code
-----------------------

First off, let's make sure you have a copy of the Xapian source and
can build it and run the tests. This is generally a little different
to if you're just installing Xapian to use it, because you'll be
working with the entire source tree rather than individual pieces. The
Xapian build system has some support for this, but let's get you a
copy of everything first:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://git.xapian.org/xapian
   $ cd xapian

This will 'clone' a complete copy of the Xapian source code, including
not only the core library but also the various language bindings (for
use from Python, Lua, Ruby and so on) and the self-contained web
search system 'Omega'. It also contains all the tests for those
various components.

Installing the dependencies
---------------------------

Debian / Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu, this command should ensure you have
all the necessary tools and libraries:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install build-essential m4 perl python3 zlib1g-dev uuid-dev \
     wget bison tcl libpcre3-dev libmagic-dev valgrind ccache eatmydata \
     doxygen graphviz help2man pngcrush python3-docutils python3-sphinx \
     mono-devel default-jdk lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev php-cli php-dev \
     python3-dev ruby-dev tcl-dev texinfo

macOS
~~~~~

You need to install Apple's XCode tools, which contain their compiler,
debugger and various other tools. You can do that from within the
AppStore.

We recommend using `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ to install and manage
additional libraries and tools on macOS. Once you've installed XCode
and homebrew, you can get all the dependencies you need for Xapian
using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ brew install libmagic pcre \
     lua mono perl php python3 ruby tcl-tk \
     doxygen help2man graphviz pngcrush
   # and some python-specific documentation tools
   $ pip3 install sphinx docutils

Windows
~~~~~~~

Building using MSVC is supported by the autotools build system.  You need
to install a set of Unix-like tools first -- we recommend `MSYS2
<https://www.msys2.org/>`_.

For details of how to specify MSVC to ``configure`` see the "INSTALL" document
in ``xapian-core``.

When building from git, by default you'll need some extra tools to generate
Unicode tables (Tcl) and build documentation (doxygen, help2man, sphinx-doc).
We don't currently have detailed advice on how to do this (if you can provide
some then please send a patch).

You can avoid needing Tcl by copying ``xapian-core/unicode/unicode-data.cc``
from another platform or a release which uses the same Unicode version.  You
can avoid needing most of the documentation tools by running configure with
the ``--disable-documentation`` option.

On other platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need the following tools installed to build from git:

* GNU m4 >= 4.6 (for autoconf)
* perl >= 5.6 (for automake; also for various maintainer scripts)
* python >= 3.3 (for generating the Python bindings)
* GNU make (or another make which support VPATH for explicit rules)
* GNU bison (for building SWIG, used for generating the bindings)
* Tcl (to generate unicode/unicode-data.cc)

There are also a number of libraries you'll need available, including
development headers:

* `zlib <https://zlib.net>`_
* `libuuid <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/libuuid>`_
* `PCRE2 <https://www.pcre.org>`_
* libmagic (which is part of `the open source implementation of file(1) <https://www.darwinsys.com/file/>`_)

.. On Fedora, yum install libuuid-devel -- can we get a more complete list?

If you're doing much development work, you'll probably also want the following
tools installed:

* `valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_ for better testsuite error finding
* `ccache <https://ccache.dev>`_ for faster rebuilds
* `eatmydata <https://www.flamingspork.com/projects/libeatmydata/>`_ for faster testsuite runs

If you want to be able to build distribution tarballs (with ``make dist``) then
you'll also need some further tools:

* doxygen (v1.8.8 is used for 1.3.x snapshots and releases; 1.7.6.1 fails to
  process git master after ``PL2Weight`` was added).
* dot (part of Graphviz.  Doxygen's ``DOT_MULTI_TARGETS`` option apparently needs
  ">1.8.10")
* help2man
* rst2html or rst2html.py (``pip install docutils``)
* pngcrush (optional - used to reduce the size of PNG files in the HTML
  apidocs)
* sphinx-doc (``pip install sphinx`` should do)

Building Xapian
---------------

Bootstrapping the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way of building Xapian from git master is to use our bootstrap
script. It takes care of a number of things which are otherwise fiddly to get
right, including checking you have the right version of various tools we use,
and setting up the build system for you.

.. note::

   One thing that bootstrap does is to set up a top-level ``configure`` script
   which ensures that the in-tree version of ``xapian-core`` is built first and
   then used for building everything else. You almost certainly want to build
   Xapian this way.

   Not using this means you have to check by hand that you're building other
   subdirectories against the in-tree core library, as by default they will pick
   any installed copy. An installed copy of Xapian is likely to be a different
   version to the source tree you are building. Building the git master version
   of Xapian against an earlier released library will probably fail. If you're
   working on Xapian then you almost certainly want to build everything against
   the in-tree version, so you should use ``bootstrap`` and the ``configure``
   script it creates.

The repository does not contain any automatically generated files
(such as ``configure``, ``Makefile.in``, Snowball-generated stemmers, Lemon-generated
parsers, SWIG-generated code, and so on) because experience shows it's best to keep
these out of version control.  To avoid requiring you to install the correct
versions of the tools required, we either include the source to these tools in
the repo directly (in the case of Snowball and Lemon), or the bootstrap script
will download them as tarballs (autoconf, automake, libtool) or
from git (SWIG), build them, and install them within the source tree.

The bootstrap script doesn't care what the current directory is, but you
can easily run it in the ``xapian`` directory that was created earlier when you
cloned the source code:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./bootstrap

To download some tools, bootstrap will use ``wget``, ``curl`` or
``lwp-request`` if installed.  If not, it will give an error telling
you the URL to download from by hand and where to copy the file to. You
can control whether Xapian tries to download, patch and install autotools
with the ``--download-tools`` option to ``bootstrap``:

``--download-tools=always``
       Always download, patch and install autotools we rely on.

``--download-tools=ifneeded`` (the default)
       Download, patch and install autotools only if your installed version
       isn't recent enough, or if we have to apply patches that haven't yet
       been accepted upstream.

``--download-tools=never``
        Never download and install autotools; always use your installed
        versions.

        Note that in this case the build may fail if you have out of date
        versions of the tools, and you may also fall foul of behaviour fixed
        in our patches.

You can also ask the build system to delete the downloaded and installed
versions by passing ``--clean``.

Our bootstrap script will check which directories you have checked out,
so you can bootstrap a partial tree.  You can also ``touch .nobootstrap`` in
a subdirectory to tell bootstrap to ignore it, or you can pass just the
directories you want to build as arguments to ``bootstrap``.

If you need to add any extra macro directories to the path searched by aclocal
(which is part of automake), you can do this by specifying these in the
``ACLOCAL_FLAGS`` environment variable. For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ACLOCAL_FLAGS=-I/extra/macro/directory ./bootstrap

.. note::

   As well as installing some tools, bootstrap will also run
   ``autoreconf`` on each of the checked-out subdirectories, and
   generate a top-level ``configure`` script.  This configure script
   allows you to configure xapian-core and any other modules you've
   checked out with a single simple command, such that the other modules
   link against the uninstalled xapian-core (which is very handy for
   development work and a bit fiddly to set up by hand).  It
   automatically passes ``--enable-maintainer-mode`` to the
   subprojects so that the autotools will be rerun if
   ``configure.ac``, ``Makefile.am``, etc are modified.

.. warning::

   If you are tracking development in git, there will sometimes be
   changes to the build system sources which require regeneration of
   the generated makefiles and associated machinery.  We aim to make
   the build system automatically regenerate the necessary files, but
   in the event that a build fails after an update, it may be worth
   re-running the bootstrap script to regenerate the build system from
   scratch, before looking for the cause of the error elsewhere.

Configuring the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring the code is mostly about Xapian's build system
automatically detecting where all its dependencies are on your
computer, so it knows how to use them. However there are various
options that allow you to either override the autodetection
(for instance if you wanted to build python bindings
against a particular version of python) or change some defaults.
To find out about the configure options available, you can run
``configure --help``. For now, however, we'll just run it accepting
all its defaults:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./configure

Note that on macOS you probably want to turn off the Perl and TCL8
bindings when developing, as there are some complexities when
developing against the system versions, and the homebrew versions are
slightly awkward:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./configure --without-perl --without-tcl

Our configure script supports building in a separate directory to
the sources. Simply create the directory you want to build in, and then run the
configure script from inside that directory.  For example, to build in a
directory called "build" (starting in the top level source directory):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./bootstrap
   # output from bootstrap
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure

Building Xapian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building Xapian is just a matter of typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make

First it will build xapian-core, the core library. Then it will build
Omega and the language bindings, using the version of xapian-core
you've just built, but not yet installed. (This is the bit that causes
some problems on macOS if you use system versions of any of the
languages.)

Running the tests
-----------------

Xapian has a comprehensive test suite, and it's a good idea to get
into the habit of running it. From the top of the clone, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make check

Again, the tests for xapian-core are run first, then Omega and then
the language bindings. If any test fails, the build system will stop
there.

A quick note about the build system
-----------------------------------

Here, we've been working from a clone of the Xapian git repository,
which means that the following options are on by default.
However if you are ever building from a source tarball,
the following may be of use.

``--enable-maintainer-mode``
	This tells configure to enable make dependencies for
	regenerating build system files (such as ``configure``,
	``Makefile.in``, and ``Makefile``) and other generated files
        when required.  These are disabled by default as some make
        programs try to rebuild them when it's not appropriate
        (e.g. BSD make doesn't handle VPATH except for implicit
        rules).  For this reason, we recommend GNU make if you enable
        maintainer mode.

        For ``xapian-core``, generated files include the stemmers
        and query parser; you'll need a non-cross-compiling C compiler for
	compiling the Lemon parser generator and the Snowball stemming
	algorithm compiler.  The configure script will attempt to
	locate one, but you can override this autodetection by passing
        ``CC_FOR_BUILD`` on the command line like so:

        .. code-block:: bash

           ./configure CC_FOR_BUILD=/opt/bin/gcc

        For ``xapian-bindings``, generated files include the bindings
        glue code, which requires SWIG. You'll need to have maintainer
        mode enabled if you're going to work on the bindings at all.

``--enable-documentation``
	This tells configure to enable make dependencies for regenerating
	documentation files.  By default it uses the same setting as
	``--enable-maintainer-mode``. You can turn off documentation
        rules in maintainer mode (which means that documentation won't be
        rebuilt on ``make check``, which will save some time) by passing
        ``--disable-documentation`` to configure.

        Note that ``make dist`` requires the documentation to have been
        built, and so won't work with a git checkout if you disable
        building the documentation. You can still configure and build the
        code itself.

Xapian's build system has a lot of other options you can use to
control exactly what gets built and in what ways. Check out help
information for the various tools for more information, such as
``./bootstrap --help`` and ``./configure --help``.

Summary
-------

Now you've got everything working, you probably want to look at
:ref:`contributing to Xapian<contributing>`, or if you're trying to fix a bug
then you might want to learn about :ref:`debugging Xapian<debugging>`.
