# Xapian developer guide

This is the source for [Xapian's developer
guide](https://xapian-developer-guide.readthedocs.org/).
Eventually this repository will be merged into the main Xapian tree.

You will need the [Sphinx documentation tool](https://sphinx-doc.org/)
installed to process this documentation. You can install the `python-sphinx`
package on Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu, or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
to install the python package directly.

With that installed, you can then build the HTML output by running `make html`.

You can chat to us on matrix, IRC or via our mailing lists.  Links to
all of these are [on our website](https://xapian.org/lists).
